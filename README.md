# Performance Measure
Using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for fetching data from a movie database can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of your web application. AJAX allows you to make asynchronous requests to the server without reloading the entire page, enabling a smoother user experience.
In an app that retrieves data from a movie database, AJAX can be utilized for various tasks such as fetching movie details, searching for specific movies, loading lists of movies, and more. Here's how AJAX enhances performance and user experience.
# Challenges Faced and Solutions
